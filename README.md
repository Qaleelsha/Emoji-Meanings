I developed an emoji recognition and understanding model using Python in Google Colab. By leveraging the powerful emoji library, I was able to efficiently parse, interpret, and categorize emojis in text data. Letâ€™s take a deeper look into the meaning of some emojis that we use in our daily lives. This project not only demonstrates my ability to apply Python in natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also highlights my skills in integrating libraries to extract meaningful insights from diverse forms of data.
